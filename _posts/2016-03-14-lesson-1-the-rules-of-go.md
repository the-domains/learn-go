New to the game of Go? Check this page first. The rules are simple and it takes no more than 5 minutes to know them. Have fun!

Some basic rules first.

* Go is a turn-based, 2-player game between black and white
* Players take turns playing one piece at a time to the board (the pieces are called "stones")
* Stones are placed in the intersections of horizontal and vertical lines on the board
* Once you play a stone, it can't be moved (but it may get removed later)

Here are some stones on a Go board:

## Step 1 - let's capture some stones!

To capture some stones, you need to surround it. Go is sometimes called "The Surrounding Game" after all.

This white stone is about to be surrounded. All but one of it's adjacent intersections are taken by black.

If black plays one more stone next to the white stone, it will be captured and taken off the board.

White can save the white stone by playing next to the white stone first.

That's all for now. See you in the next lesson!
