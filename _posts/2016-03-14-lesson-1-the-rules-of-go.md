# Lesson 1 - The Rules of Go

Let's learn some basic rules first.

* Go is a turn-based, 2-player game between black and white
* One of the player takes the black pieces and plays first
* The other player takes white pieces
* The pieces are called stones
* Stones are placed in the intersections of lines on the board
* Once you play a stone, it can't be moved (but it may get removed)

Here are some stones on a Go board:

## Step 1 - let's capture some stones!

To capture some stones, you need to surround it. Go is sometimes called "The Surrounding Game" after all.

This white stone is about to be surrounded. All but one of it's adjacent intersections are taken by black.

If black plays one more stone next to the white stone, it will be captured and taken off the board.

White can save the white stone
