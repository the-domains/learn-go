# Lesson 2 - Groups

As you learned in the previous lesson, a stone has up to 4 liberties on the board and the opponent needs to take all of them to capture the stone.

To make your stones stronger, you can _connect_ them. Connected stones are right next to each other, and they **share liberties**. That means that 2 adjacent stones of the same color have _6 liberties_ instead of 4\. Pretty cool.

The more stones you can connect, the better. Connected stones are called groups. Groups are good, because they make your stones harder to capture.
