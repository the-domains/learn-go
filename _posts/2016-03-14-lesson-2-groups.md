# Lesson 2 - Groups

As you learned in the previous lesson, a stone has up to 4 liberties on the board and the opponent needs to take all of them to capture the stone.

To make your stones stronger, you can _connect_ them. Connected stones are right next to each other, and they **share liberties**. That means that 2 adjacent stones of the same color have _6 liberties_ instead of 4\. Pretty cool.

The more stones you can connect, the better. Connected stones are called groups. Groups are good, because they make your stones harder to capture.

White player needs to play 6 times to capture the black group of 2\.
